    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This one-pot easy ratatouille recipe is a hearty and satisfying
        vegetarian stew to make any night of the week. Though it comes
        together in just about 45 minutes, it benefits greatly from an hour
        or so of rest. The vegetables relax and get to know the herbs and a
        big loud summer garden party starts in your pot. The beauty of a
        ratatouille is it’s delicious served in so many ways: hot or cold,
        at room temperature, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, with a fried
        egg or on its own. My personal favorite is warm with a perfectly
        runny egg on top and a side of crusty bread to sop up all the
        goodness, but this is a choose-your-own-adventure kind of stew!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt the eggplant:</strong> Place the eggplant in a
            large colander in your sink. Sprinkle with salt and leave for 20
            minutes as the eggplant sweats out its bitterness. Pat dry to
            remove the water and excess salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the onion and peppers:</strong> In a large heavy
            pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium
            heat. When the oil is shimmering but not smoking, add the
            onions. Cook, stirring regularly, until they’re translucent
            (about 5 minutes). Now add the bell peppers and cook for another
            4 minutes, and continue to stir as they soften.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the remaining veggies:</strong> Add the garlic,
            tomatoes and any of their juice, zucchini, eggplant, wine, and
            thyme. Stir in the black pepper, paprika, and rosemary. Season
            with kosher salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Boil then simmer:</strong> Raise the heat to medium-high
            and bring to a boil for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Turn
            the heat down, then cover and simmer over low heat for 20
            minutes or so.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Season:</strong> Remove the ratatouille from the heat,
            taste, and adjust salt to your liking. Add the sherry vinegar
            and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Top with fresh basil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong> If you have time, cover and allow the
            ratatouille to rest in its warm pot for 1 hour or so before
            serving (see recipe notes). To serve, ladle into bowls.
            Optionally, top each with a sunny side up egg and pass around
            some crusty bread for dipping. Enjoy warm, at room temperature,
            cold, or any which way your heart desires.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resting:</strong> If you have the time, allow the ratatouille to rest in its warm pot for 1 hour
                or so before serving. This will allow the flavors to settle and deepen beautifully. You do not need to
                heat before serving, ratatouille is great just warm.</li>
            <li><strong>Make ahead and leftovers:</strong> You can make Ratatouille ahead and refrigerate in a sealed
                container (preferably not plastic due to the tomato’s acidity). It will keep well for 4 days or so. Take
                it out 30 minutes or so before you are ready to serve. Warm it through over gentle heat or just bring it
                to room temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Freeze ratatouille, tightly sealed, for up to three months. Thaw overnight in
                the fridge, and again bring to room temperature before serving. If you prefer warm, use gentle heat. If,
                as a result of freezing, you find the texture to have softened too much, you can puree and serve
                ratatouille more as a creamier soup with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
